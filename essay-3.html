              </h2>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                Tribal, or Adivasi, in the South Asian context has been an
                important self-identification, in the face of various invasions,
                British colonial rule and the present-day Indian state. The
                analysis of tribes differs in the South Asian region in the way
                the concept of nativity is inadequate in defining tribe. What‚Äôs
                more, there is a uniquely complex tactic of assimilation,
                involving Hindu hegemonic structures, rather than a tactic of
                eradication which differs from other regions. In this paper, I
                will investigate what makes the category of tribe difficult to
                analyze in the South Asian context.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The indigenous-settler dichotomy is one that can be successfully
                unpacked in the context of regions like North America. There was
                an active genocidal project carried out by settlers from Europe
                to eradicate the Native populations. That genocidal project
                continues today with the erasure and subsequent eradication of
                tribes that remain present-day. On the other hand, the idea of
                nativity and tribe are difficult to unpack in the context of the
                South Asian region due to a varied context. Andre B√©teille makes
                a point that the designation of the label of ‚Äúindigenous‚Äù
                requires the existence of settlements and usurpations. This is
                certainly evident in South Asia. However, there has been a slow
                and steady process of migrations that took place so far back in
                history that it makes it questionable to call present-day
                descendants settlers. This makes nativity difficult to define.
                Hence, the blanket term of ‚Äúindigenous people‚Äù being synonymous
                with ‚Äútribal people‚Äù can be misleading in the context of the
                South Asian
                <a href="#one" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="one-ref">subcontinent.</a>
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The ambiguity in nativity, through the lens of territoriality,
                language or religion, proves to make the process of analyzing
                tribes in the South Asian region difficult. I will begin by
                discussing the issue of analyzing tribes through territoriality.
                The South Asian region has witnessed continuous migrations,
                whether that is due to various usurpations and invasions of the
                region or the constant migration of hunter-gatherer and
                pastoralist communities. Due to this, territoriality becomes an
                ambiguous plane to determine nativity. For example, in many
                multi-caste villages in West Bengal, people of tribal origin
                have settled from elsewhere while there are simultaneously
                non-tribal people in the village that have resided there for a
                longer
                <a href="#two" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="two-ref">
                  time.</a>
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                Apart from territoriality, investigating ambiguous paths of
                language and dialect as markers of tribal identity is also
                necessary. There has often been a false dichotomy of tribal vs.
                non-tribal languages stated, with tribal languages being
                primitive dialectics belonging to Austri-Asiatic and
                Tibeto-Burman families while non-tribal languages belonging to
                Indo-European and Dravidian families. This dichotomy is quickly
                contradicted when we see that several tribes speak a regional
                language or so called ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù language and have no specific
                dialectic of their own. It is difficult to pinpoint if and when
                adoption of regional languages by tribal populations began.
                Another issue is that one cannot say that tribal dialects have
                existed longer than regional
                <a href="#three" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="three-ref">languages,</a>
                especially given the existence of various Dravidian languages.
                This reinforces that language isn‚Äôt always a means to categorize
                or define tribe, in the South Asian context.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                Religion is another important plane of investigation in the
                analysis of tribe in the South Asian region. While there
                certainly has been a distinction between tribal religions and
                predominant Hinduism, this dichotomy is difficult to create when
                there are various examples of tribal lineages establishing Hindu
                <a href="#four" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="four-ref">
                  kingdoms.</a>
                Furthermore, it is a fact that the thousands of castes and
                tribes present in South Asia over centuries have influenced each
                other‚Äôs religious beliefs and practices for
                <a href="#five" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="five-ref">centuries.</a>
                Taking the ambiguous plane of nativity in the context of
                territoriality, language and religion, it can be said that
                tribalism is not synonymous with indigeneity. Hence, the
                categorization and analysis of tribes in South Asia is difficult
                to carry out through the concept of indigeneity, unlike in other
                regions like North America.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                It is evident that amidst various external settlements and
                internal migrations, tribal and nontribal populations have
                historically coexisted for
                <a href="#six" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="six-ref">millenia.</a>
                The way colonial and imperial regimes interacted with and
                controlled tribal populations differs from the frequented
                explicitly genocidal tactics seen in regions like North America.
                Rather than a tactic of eradication, there has been a historical
                tactic of assimilation applied when interacting with tribal
                communities.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para"></p>
              Mamdani elicits how this assimilationist project is part of
              indirect rule, ‚Äúinvolving reproduction of already established
              [Brahmanical] customs rather than an abolishing of
              <a href="#seven" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="seven-ref">barbarism.‚Äù</a>
              This assimilationist tactic occurs through adherence to the
              already established caste system through propagation of Hindu
              method of tribal absorption. Hence, there is a legacy of tribes
              being
              <a href="#eight" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="eight-ref">‚ÄúHinduized‚Äù.</a>
              The case of the Mahato of Chotanagpur tribe being declassified as
              Kurmi-Mahato caste of Bihar in 1921 elicit
              <a href="#nine" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nine-ref">
                this.</a>

              <p class="essays-article-para">
                It is the issue of caste that makes the analysis of tribe in the
                South Asian region so uniquely complex. B√©teille points out how
                in regions like Medieval Poland and Morocco, there has also been
                a slow assimilation of tribal society into general society. It
                is a uniquely Indian characteristic for tribal assimilation to
                be accompanied by the formation of the caste
                <a href="#ten" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="ten-ref">system.</a>
                It is to be noted that this tribal absorption most often
                involved the conversion of tribal populations into low-castes
                within the Hindu
                <a href="#eleven" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="eleven-ref">fold.</a>
                This elicits how this assimilationist tactic in the South Asia
                region not only existed to maintain Hindu caste hegemony but
                structurally subordinate tribal populations.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                While the analysis of tribe in the South Asia context requires
                us to investigate the ‚ÄúHinduization‚Äù of tribe, it requires us to
                go beyond it as well. This assimilationist project affects many
                Adivasi communities, but there are simultaneously many
                self-sufficient tribal communities that have escaped Hindu caste
                absorption such as various tribes in Andaman <a href="#twelve" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="twelve-ref">Islands.</a>
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The analysis of tribe in the South Asian context poses to be uniquely complex as the concept of nativity
                is inadequate as a plane of analysis. Furthermore, rather than a project of eradication, the
                assimilationist project of Hindu tribal absorption is instead applied, which often blurs the line
                between tribe and caste, making tribe a complex point of analysis. While many Adivasi populations have
                been assimilated into Hindu hegemonic structures, there are also various tribes that live in
                self-sufficient communities untouched by both Hindu society and the state. In this way, the analysis of
                tribe in the South Asian context is uniquely complex in the way it must take into account the various
                contradictions that simultaneously exist.
