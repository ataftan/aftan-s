                  Universalizations and Reductive Commodification of Indigeneity

              </h2>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The category of indigenous or tribal in the South Asian region
                has proved to carry various nuances, having emerged as an
                administrative identity in the colonial <a href="#one" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="one-ref">period.</a>
                It was an
                identity asserted on tribal people, with the ‚ÄúDepressed class‚Äù
                <a href="#two" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="two-ref">category.</a> Postcolonial India witnessed
                a change in perception of
                administrative identity. The tribal identity is not necessarily
                asserted by the state in present-day India but rather something
                one needs to lay evidence of proof <a href="#three" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="three-ref">for.</a> This shift stands as a
                pretense to the development of the politics of indigeneity,
                which is built on false universalizations of the ‚Äútribal way of
                life‚Äù. Furthermore, the politics of indigeneity pursues a
                reductive commodification of indigeneity as an organizing
                principle while simultaneously distorting the principles of the
                ideology that is claimed to be pertinent to indigeneity.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The category of tribe is one with various nuances which can be
                useful in assessing present day issues around tribal or
                indigenous populations. There has been a historical tactic of
                assimilation that constructed the administrative identity of
                <a href="#four" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="four-ref">‚Äòtribe‚Äô.</a> In this manner, the
                category of tribe has a legacy of
                colonial legislature. The label of ‚ÄúDepressed classes‚Äù which
                emerged from 19th century England, was utilized in the colonial
                period to refer to so-called ‚Äúbackward‚Äù classes which included
                tribal people. There was an evident shift in administrative
                identity of tribal people in the post-colonial Indian state-
                from criminalization of tribes to a mission of upliftment
                utilized by the state. Language is a tool utilized to construct
                and reinvent narratives. Thus, it is necessary to consider this
                shift as a pretense to the development of the politics of
                indigeneity.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                I will first investigate this shift by investigating the
                connotations of labels used for indigenous people in India post
                1930s. Adivasi, a modern Sanskrit word, was coined in the 1930s
                during political movements to forge a differentiated identity
                for indigenous people in <a href="#five" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="five-ref">India;</a> This
                term holds important
                socio-political connotations of self-identification. Despite the
                prevalence of this term, the Indian state still does not
                recognize tribal people or Adivasis to be the indigenous people
                of India. Instead tribal people are characterized with a trait
                of backwardness and in need of ‚Äúsocial and economic
                development.‚Äù This is seen with lists of tribes labeled under
                the category of ‚ÄúScheduled Tribes‚Äù (ST), which is built on the
                pretense of representational upliftment with no active material
                <a href="#six" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="six-ref">equality.</a> The colonial legacies of
                categories such as ‚ÄúDepressed
                Class‚Äù are evident here. This kind of state legibility ,defined
                by an alleged ‚Äúbackwardness‚Äù, is mirrored in even present day
                notions of indigeneity in political and social movements.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The politics of indigeneity is defined by an imagined idea of
                indigeneity that is expected to be performed for a largely
                non-indigenous audience. This is firstly seen in ways Adivasi
                people have to perform their ‚Äútribalness‚Äù and lack of alleged
                modernity to be considered legible for the ST category. But
                beyond that, the role of indigeneity in political and social
                movements also insists on a performative idea of <a href="#seven" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="seven-ref">tribalness.</a>
                There is a construction of a false universalization of a tribal
                way of life or indigenous identity, which is not only
                assumptious but not consensual. This is seen with the UN‚Äôs
                Working Group on Indigenous Populations which claims to provide
                solidarity to a globalized field of indigenous <a href="#eight" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="eight-ref">politics,</a>
                whether that includes tribes in India or Peru. The
                universalization of the indigenous or tribal identity is
                disingenuous and simply false, and makes certain stereotypical
                assumptions of their lives characterized by a so-called
                ‚Äúbackwardness.‚Äù The tribal way of life is defined by strong
                relations to the land and nature, with tribal people often being
                denoted as ‚Äúdefenders‚Äù of the land and <a href="#nine" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="nine-ref">water.</a> In the face of
                climate crisis and late-stage capitalism, tribal people have
                become harbingers of a longed for past and hopes for alternative
                futures.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                It is true, many indigenous people have historically meaningful
                relationships to land with spiritual and cultural connections
                not attached to nationhood. In the face of settler-colonialism
                and implict tactics of cultural genocide, it is in fact
                necessary to center the voices of indigenous populations who
                have been historically targeted by the state and collaborators,
                especially when talking about issues like climate <a href="#ten" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="ten-ref">crisis</a> and
                state <a href="#eleven" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="eleven-ref">violence.</a> In this way, the
                politics of indigeneity is a
                necessary project in giving marginalized populations a larger
                role in socio-political movements and highlighting issues that
                various indigenous populations face. This development of
                indigenous politics can also be useful in pursuing a kind of
                representational politics that is productive in decentering
                stereotypes of various tribes and indigenous populations. What‚Äôs
                more, centering issues affecting different indigenous groups in
                socio-political movements is essential when talking about the
                ongoing crises around climate change and state violence.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                The politics of indigeneity creates space for issues affecting
                indigenous people. At the same time, it involves a
                non-consensual idealization of indigenous populations, by
                non-indigenous people in political and social movement, often
                using ideas of indigeneity as a prop. The characterization of
                indigenous people as those with strong relationships to the land
                relies on stereotypical assumptions of indigenous people being
                ‚Äúforest dwellers'', which is forefronted on a particular image
                of backwardness defined by a lack of modernity. I will elaborate
                on these ideas by looking at narratives of revolutionary Maoist
                movements in <a href="#twelve" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="twelve-ref">India.</a>
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                Arundhati Roy‚Äôs ‚ÄúWalking with the Comrades‚Äù gives important
                insight into Adivasi groups of the Dandakaranya region in the
                People's Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), which is the armed
                front of the Communist Party of India <a href="#thirteen" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="thirteen-ref">(Maoist).</a> It is evident,
                from this book and beyond, that the ideology of Maoism is
                significant in the ways it inspires many peasants, women and
                indigenous people, who utilize its principles to seek
                liberation, survival and self-determination. At the same time,
                Roy and various other intellectuals utilize the politics of
                indigeneity to curate rather disingenuous narratives of the
                Maoist movement being an indigenous <a href="#fourteen" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="fourteen-ref">movement.</a>
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                Overplaying the role of indigenous people in Maoist movements,
                and framing them as leaders of the movement, co-opts the idea of
                indigeneity for one‚Äôs, albeit important, political agenda. This
                is evident in Roy‚Äôs book as she romanticizes the role of
                forest-dwelling Adivasis in the PLGA. One again, the politics of
                indigeneity is asserted by revolutionary intellectuals like Roy
                under the pretense of backwardness or lack of modernity. Alpa
                Shah denotes this as eco-incarceration, which she defines as
                ‚Äúlocking of indigenous people in their rootedness to the land
                and harmony with the <a href="#fifteen" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="fifteen-ref">land.‚Äù</a>
                This kind of politics romanticizes
                indigenous peoples‚Äô relationship with natural resources to use
                them as cultural symbols for their own <a href="#sixteen" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
                  id="sixteen-ref">agenda.</a> Not only is this
                disingenuous to the indigenous people who are part of these
                revolutionary movements, but commodifies indigeneity as a
                selling point for a particular ideology.
              </p>

              <p class="essays-article-para">
                It is indeed important to see what populations are participating
                in particular movements as that tells you a lot about the
                pursuits of the ideology and who it is oriented towards. At the
                same time, to overplay the role of particular groups for your
                own agenda by framing the Maoist movement as an indigenous
                movement does two things. Firstly, it distorts the diverse means
                of pursuing the politics of indigeneity which are not always
                through a Marxist lens. An example of this are indigenous social
                movements like the Naramada Bachao Andolan. Secondly, quite to
                its contradiction, it distorts the ideological principles of
                Maoism. Framing the Maoist movement as an indigenous movement
                underplays the issue of class struggles that Maoism centers its
                principles around. To frame a particular movement around an
                imagined idea of indigeneity radically simplifies its activism
                based on class struggle and dialectical materialism. What‚Äôs
                more, it also undermines the cultural politics of Adivasi groups
                by presenting a distortion of their roots as simply<a href="#seventeen"
                  aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="seventeen-ref"> Maoist.</a> The
                principles of Maoism would ask for the opposite and insist on a
                dialectical analysis of the relationship between class struggles
                and indigeneity in pursuing the politics of indigeneity rather
                than a reductive co-optation of indigneous struggles.
              </p>
              <p class="essays-article-para">
                In conclusion, the politics of indigeneity is a necessary
                project in the way it gives indigenous populations a larger role
                in socio-political movements and centers the issues of various
                indigenous populations in the face of climate crisis and state
                violence. At the same time, this particular politics stands on a
                false universalization of the ‚Äútribal way of life‚Äù which pursues
                a reductive commodification of indigeneity as an organizing
                principle when it claims the Maoist movement to be an indigenous
                movement. What‚Äôs more, in the process of co-opting indigeneity,
                this particular politics simultaneously distorts the principles
                of the very ideology that is claimed to be pertinent to
                indigeneity.
